# ADR-001: Core Architecture Decisions

Date: 2024-03-27

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context

We need to establish the core architecture for the Claims Processing Assistant MCP server. The system needs to handle claims processing with AI integration, maintain data persistence, and provide a reliable API interface.

## Decision

We have decided to implement the following architectural components:

1. **Technology Stack**
   - Node.js with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
   - MCP Protocol for standardized communication
   - Supabase for data persistence and authentication
   - Docker for containerization and deployment

2. **Architecture Pattern**
   - Clean Architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns
   - Domain-driven design (DDD) principles for business logic organization
   - Repository pattern for data access abstraction
   - Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) for complex operations

3. **Key Components**
   - MCP Server: Core server implementation handling protocol communication
   - Claims Engine: Business logic for claims processing
   - Validation Engine: Rules engine for claim validation
   - AI Integration Layer: Interface with AI models for claims analysis
   - Data Access Layer: Supabase integration and data persistence
   - Audit Trail: Logging and tracking system for claims processing

## Consequences

### Positive

- Strong type safety with TypeScript
- Clear separation of concerns with Clean Architecture
- Scalable and maintainable codebase
- Easy deployment with Docker
- Built-in authentication and real-time capabilities with Supabase
- Standardized communication with MCP Protocol

### Negative

- Learning curve for team members new to some technologies
- Initial setup complexity
- Need for careful management of domain boundaries

### Neutral

- Need for comprehensive documentation
- Regular architecture reviews required
- Team training on chosen technologies
