# ClaimProcessingAssistant MCP Server - Project Planning

## Overview

The ClaimProcessingAssistant MCP server is a specialized system that provides AI assistants with the ability to interact with insurance claim processing workflows and data. It leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to expose claim processing capabilities to AI assistants like Claude, ChatGPT, or Cursor, allowing them to help with claim validation, processing, and management through natural language.

## Problem Statement

Insurance claim processing often involves complex workflows, rule validation, data extraction, and integration with various systems. This project aims to simplify these processes by providing an AI-driven interface that can:

- Help validate insurance claims
- Extract relevant information from claim documents
- Guide users through the claim submission process
- Provide status updates on pending claims
- Assist with claim adjudication decisions based on policy rules
- Generate reports and analytics on claim processing efficiency

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **TypeScript**: Primary programming language for type-safe development
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for the server
- **Supabase**: Backend-as-a-Service for database, authentication, and storage
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Protocol for connecting AI assistants to our system
- **Express.js**: Web server framework to handle HTTP requests
- **PostgreSQL**: Database system (via Supabase) for storing claim data

### Supporting Libraries

- **Prisma/TypeORM**: ORM for database interactions
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation
- **Jest**: Testing framework
- **Docker**: Containerization for deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline

## Architecture Overview

### System Components

1. **MCP Server Layer**

   - Implements MCP protocol handlers
   - Exposes functions for AI assistants to query and manipulate claim data
   - Provides context-aware responses about claim processing rules

2. **Business Logic Layer**

   - Claim validation rules
   - Processing workflows
   - Policy enforcement

3. **Data Access Layer**

   - Database interactions
   - Document storage
   - External API integrations (if needed)

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Connectors to external systems (payment processors, document management, etc.)
   - Webhook handlers for event-driven operations

### Data Model (High-Level)

- **Claims**: Core entity with status tracking, timestamps, claimant details
- **Policies**: Insurance policy details, coverage limits, terms
- **Documents**: Attachments and evidence supporting claims
- **Payments**: Disbursement records
- **Audit Trail**: History of claim actions and decisions

## Security Considerations

- Implement proper authentication using Supabase Auth
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Data encryption for sensitive information
- Audit logging for all claim-related actions
- Sanitize and validate all inputs from AI assistants

## Deployment Strategy

- Containerize the application using Docker
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Deploy to cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Implement monitoring and alerting

## Milestones

1. **Foundation Setup** (2 weeks)

   - Project scaffolding
   - Database schema design
   - Development environment setup

2. **MCP Server Implementation** (3 weeks)

   - Core protocol handlers
   - Basic function implementation
   - Integration with Supabase

3. **Claim Processing Logic** (4 weeks)

   - Claim validation rules
   - Workflow implementation
   - Document processing

4. **Integration and Testing** (3 weeks)

   - External system integrations
   - Comprehensive test suite
   - Performance testing

5. **Deployment and Documentation** (2 weeks)
   - Production deployment
   - Documentation
   - User guides

## Potential Challenges

- Ensuring the MCP server correctly interprets AI assistant queries
- Building robust claim validation rules that cover all edge cases
- Handling various document formats for evidence and supporting materials
- Managing state in complex claim workflows
- Ensuring system performance with large claim volumes

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in claim processing time
- Improved accuracy in claim validation
- Decreased manual intervention requirements
- Positive user feedback on AI assistant interactions
- System scalability under increasing load
