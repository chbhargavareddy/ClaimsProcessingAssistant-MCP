# ADR-002: Data Model Design

Date: 2024-03-27

## Status

ACCEPTED

## Context

The Claims Processing Assistant needs a robust data model to handle various types of claims, policies, and related documents while maintaining audit trails and supporting AI-assisted processing.

## Decision

We will implement the following data model structure:

1. **Core Entities**
   - Claims: Central entity containing claim details and status
   - Policies: Insurance policy information
   - Documents: Attached files and evidence
   - Audit Trails: Processing history and changes
   - Validation Rules: Configurable validation criteria

2. **Schema Design**
   - Use PostgreSQL with Supabase
   - Implement row-level security (RLS)
   - Use JSON columns for flexible attributes
   - Implement proper indexing strategy

3. **Relationships**
   - Claims to Policies: Many-to-One
   - Claims to Documents: One-to-Many
   - Claims to Audit Trails: One-to-Many
   - Claims to Validation Results: One-to-Many

## Consequences

### Positive

- Flexible schema for different claim types
- Strong data integrity with proper relationships
- Built-in security with RLS
- Easy querying and filtering
- Support for document management

### Negative

- More complex queries for reporting
- Need for careful index management
- Storage considerations for documents

### Neutral

- Regular database maintenance required
- Need for migration strategies
- Backup and recovery planning
